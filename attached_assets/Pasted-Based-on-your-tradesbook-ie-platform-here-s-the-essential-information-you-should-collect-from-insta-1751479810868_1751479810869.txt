Based on your tradesbook.ie platform, here's the essential information you should collect from installers during signup:

## **Essential Profile Information**

### **Business Basics**
- Full name/business name
- Email address (for login/notifications)
- Phone number (for customer contact)
- Business address
- VAT number (if applicable)
- Public liability insurance details & expiry date

### **Service Coverage**
- Primary county/area of operation
- Secondary coverage areas (willing to travel to)
- Maximum travel distance from base
- Emergency callout availability (yes/no)
- Weekend/evening availability

### **Skills & Experience**
- Years of TV installation experience
- Device types you install (Smart TVs, Gaming setups, Sound systems, etc.)
- Wall types you work with (Plasterboard, Brick, Concrete, etc.)
- Mount types you offer (Fixed, Tilt, Full Motion, Ceiling)
- Special services (Cable concealment, Soundbar installation, Antenna setup)

### **Business Operations**
- Availability schedule (Days/hours you work)
- Vehicle type (for equipment transport)
- Team size (solo/crew)
- Languages spoken

## **Profile Enhancement (Optional but Valuable)**

### **Credibility Builders**
- Professional certifications/qualifications
- Profile photo (builds trust)
- Brief bio/experience summary
- Specialties or unique selling points

### **Customer Service**
- Preferred communication method (call/text/email)
- Response time commitment
- Cleanup policy (do you clean up after installation?)

### **Pricing Transparency**
- Callout fee (if any)

## **Platform Integration**

### **Technical Setup**

- Online/offline toggle default setting
- Job acceptance radius

Based on your platform's features, I'd recommend keeping the **initial signup simple** (just the essentials) and allowing installers to **enhance their profiles later** with additional details. This reduces signup friction while still collecting what you need for job matching.

**Most Critical for Your Uber-Style System:**
1. Service area coverage
2. Phone number for instant contact
3. Insurance verification
4. Device/installation specialties
5. Availability preferences

Would you like me to design a step-by-step registration flow that collects this information in a user-friendly way?
