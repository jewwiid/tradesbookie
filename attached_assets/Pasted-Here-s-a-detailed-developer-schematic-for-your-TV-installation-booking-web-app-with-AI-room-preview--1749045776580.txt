Here’s a detailed developer schematic for your TV installation booking web app with AI room preview functionality. The goal is to ensure clarity for both front-end and back-end implementation:

⸻

🔧 PLATFORM OVERVIEW

Name (placeholder): SmartTVMount

Core Features:
	1.	Booking Flow (Typeform-style tile UI)
	2.	Photo Upload + AI Visualization (TV mounted room preview)
	3.	Admin Panel for job assignments and management
	4.	Installers Dashboard (to view, accept, and complete bookings)
	5.	Notifications & Scheduling
	6.	Payment Integration (Optional)

⸻

🖥️ FRONTEND (Next.js + TailwindCSS / shadcn/ui)

1. Homepage
	•	Simple hero: “See Your TV on the Wall Before You Book”
	•	CTA → “Start Now”

2. Booking Flow (Typeform-style)

Use multi-step form tiles:
	1.	Upload Room Photo (or skip)
	2.	Choose TV Size (tile options: 32”, 43”, 55”, 65”, etc.)
	3.	Wall Type (e.g., Drywall, Concrete, Brick – with images)
	4.	Preferred Mount Type (e.g., Fixed, Tilting, Full Motion)
	5.	Add-on Options (e.g., Cable concealment, Soundbar install)
	6.	Choose Date/Time
	7.	Enter Address & Contact Info
	8.	Review & Confirm Booking
	9.	Optional: Payment

Visual Feedback
	•	After step 1, AI preview is generated & shown by step 2 or 3.

🤖 AI VISUALIZATION MODULE

AI Feature: Preview TV mounted on the wall of uploaded photo

Flow:
	1.	User uploads photo
	2.	TV detection model (estimate best TV placement using wall detection, depth, perspective)
	3.	Overlay TV mockup on wall using:
	•	Pre-rendered TV assets (different sizes and angles)
	•	Room segmentation model (to place behind furniture, if needed)

Recommended Stack:
	•	Run on backend: Python + FastAPI
	•	Use models:
	•	Segment Anything (Meta)
	•	DPT or MiDaS for depth/perspective
	•	ControlNet or Stable Diffusion for photorealistic insertion

Optional API Service: Replicate / Banana / Together.ai

⸻

🔙 BACKEND (Node.js or Python + PostgreSQL)

Core Tables:
	•	users (email, name, phone)
	•	bookings (user_id, date, location, selected_options, image_url, ai_preview_url, status)
	•	installers (name, location, availability, jobs_assigned)
	•	admins (login, permissions)

Services:
	•	Image handling (upload to Cloudinary or S3)
	•	Booking scheduler (availability + time slot locking)
