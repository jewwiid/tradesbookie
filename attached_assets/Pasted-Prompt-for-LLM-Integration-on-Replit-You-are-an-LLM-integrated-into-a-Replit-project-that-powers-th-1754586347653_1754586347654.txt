Prompt for LLM Integration on Replit

You are an LLM integrated into a Replit project that powers the AI comparison tool on Tracebook.ie.  Your task is to transform the questionnaire design described below into an interactive component.  Follow these steps:
	1.	Collect product model numbers – create two input fields where the user enters or scans the model numbers/product codes of the two products they wish to compare.  These codes will be used to look up specifications and pricing.
	2.	Select the product category – provide a drop‑down list of product categories (e.g., headphones, soundbars, televisions, robot vacuums, washing machines, refrigerators, dishwashers, microwaves, electric kettles, toasters, coffee makers).  Once a category is selected, load the relevant set of three questions.
	3.	Display category‑specific questions – present the three multiple‑choice questions associated with the chosen category.  Each question should include predefined answer options.  Capture the user’s selections.
	4.	Invoke the recommendation engine – send the product codes and the user’s responses as structured inputs to the AI comparison engine to generate a recommendation.  Display the outcome and highlight which product better suits the customer’s needs.

Below is the questionnaire design with schematics and question sets for each category.  Use this information to dynamically generate the questions after the user selects a category.  Do not display all questions at once; only show the relevant set.

Output Format

When building this on Replit, structure the data so that each category’s questions and answer options can be easily retrieved via a key (e.g., use a JSON object or dictionary).  The AI recommendation engine should receive an object containing:
	•	model1 and model2: the product codes entered by the user.
	•	category: one of the categories listed above.
	•	responses: an array of the user’s answer choices for the three questions.

Use this object to query the back‑end AI and return the comparison results to the user.
