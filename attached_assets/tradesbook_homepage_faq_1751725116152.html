# Why Book Professional TV Installation?

*Addressing common concerns about professional installation vs DIY*

---

## "Can't I just mount my TV myself? It doesn't look that complicated."

Modern TVs present unique challenges that catch even experienced DIYers:

- **Weight & Physics:** Today's 65" and 75" TVs weigh 30-40kg with massive leverage forces. Small mounting errors can cause catastrophic failure months later.
- **New Build Complexity:** Modern homes have metal studs, irregular spacing, hidden pipes, and cables that require professional detection tools.
- **AI Room Analysis:** Our platform uses AI to assess your specific room layout, wall type, and potential complications before installation.
- **Insurance Protection:** Our vetted installers carry full liability insurance. If something goes wrong, you're completely protected.

> **Time Reality Check:** DIY typically takes 8-15 hours (research, shopping, installation, troubleshooting). Professional installation: 1-2 hours.

## "I'm handy with tools. What could possibly go wrong?"

Being handy is great! But TV mounting has unique gotchas that surprise even experienced DIYers:

### New Build Wall Construction
Metal studs, double walls, and irregular spacing fool even professional stud finders. One wrong drill and you hit a pipe.

### 75" TV Physics
40kg TVs create massive leverage forces. Small mounting errors can cause wall failure months later when you're not expecting it.

### Cable Management Nightmare
Running cables through walls without hitting existing wiring requires experience. One wrong move kills power to half your house.

### Insurance Liability
If your DIY mount fails and damages your €2,500 OLED or injures someone, you're 100% liable. Our installers carry €1M coverage.

> **Smart DIYer's Choice:** Many of our customers are very capable with tools. They choose professional installation because their time is worth more than the cost, they want insurance protection, and they prefer guaranteed results.

## "Is the market for professional TV installation really that big?"

The premium TV installation market is bigger than most people realize:

### New Build Boom
People moving into €400k+ houses aren't putting €300 TVs on the wall. They're buying 65" and 75" premium TVs as part of the "dream home" package.

### Premium TV Sales Growth
€1,500+ TV sales have exploded. Working from home normalized premium home entertainment investments. People cut back on holidays but spend more on home.

### Harvey Norman Partnership
Our partnership with Ireland's largest electronics retailer gives us direct access to customers buying premium TVs who need professional installation.

**Market Reality:** Even if only 10% of premium TV buyers want professional installation, that's thousands of jobs annually. And these customers are exactly the ones willing to pay fair prices for quality work.
